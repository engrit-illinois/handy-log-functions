# Summary
Some handy, feature-rich log functions, intended for use within custom PowerShell modules.  
I frequently re-use this code in my various custom modules, so I gave it a dedicated home here.  

# Usage
See documentation in the code. Making effective use of this function requires understanding the need and the code itself, so I won't go into it in this readme.
